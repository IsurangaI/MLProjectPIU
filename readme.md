Machine Learning Project (Pump It Up Challenge)

Preprocessing
Mean and max frequent values were used to fill out null values in numerical values. (public meeting, permit)

Encoding the Categorical Data
Label encoding was used for categorical features.

Feature Engineering

Creating new features

Feature Selection
since the ""construction_year has number of different values, a new feature "decade" was added.
Features like 'management_group','scheme_management','quantity_group','source_class','source_type','quality_group','payment_type','extraction_type_class','extraction_type', 'waterpoint_type_group' were dropped since other columns shared the same information.
